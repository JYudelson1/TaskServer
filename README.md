# TaskServer

A simple python package for running a TaskServer on a local network. It automatically serves tasks to TaskClients on the same network.

This is basically a wrapper for all the network stuff I don't want to deal with when running a distributed project.

TODO:
- Bundle TaskClient into executables
- Make into an actual python module (setup, etc)
- More tests & examples in /tests
- Support for a public-facing server
